# Visualization-Project-on-Tableau
This is the third Udacity project in the Data Foundation Nanodegree. This project focused on cleaning the data from Kaggle to analyze the data to answer a series of questions. The data is a database of flight delays and cancellations information. All visualizations were created on Tableau and presented in Tableau Public.
